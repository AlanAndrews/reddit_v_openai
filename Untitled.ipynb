Nope. Wouldn\\'t touch it with a barge pole.\\n\\nCheeky edit: Well as I didn\\'t expect this casual comment or even this post to go as big as this. Let me add some context to me above comments.\\n\\n90s were a magical time. No 24 hour news. No social media. No instant knowledge of things happening the other side of the world. I don\\'t think anyone was really aware of the gun movement, America\\'s own brand of racism, there was no access to the deep divisions, or who knows maybe it wasn\\'t always so divided, but either way it wasn\\'t on your every day British persons radar, and neither was any crime statistics etc. It was all looked on with massive positivity. \\n\\nAmerica was the Fresh Prince, The Simpsons, mega movie stars and singers, a place for amazingly cheap shopping, good value holidays to Disney World (us Brits don\\'t do the California one), Pam Anderson running along a beach with Knight rider, GET OFF MY PLANE, that bloke from Naked Gun having a showbiz trial, even cameras in the courtroom was a complete novelty, a mountain of food for $5 in a diner, Hakuna Matata, a cheeky charasmatic youthful President, a blinding Olympics in Atlanta, an amazing World Cup... \\n\\nNot even Columbine was off putting because at the time, it was believed that *clearly* that was a one off horrific act that couldn\\'t possibly be repeated.\\n\\nBut now, with our 24 hour news, all in sundry mouthing off on Twitter, Facebook and Fake News, the racial issues, gun toting mullety men mixed with me now being a proper adult and seeing America doesn\\'t have universal healthcare, has draconian alcohol laws, awful employment law... It\\'s just not the dreamland it genuinely was in the 90s.\\n\\nIt you offered ANY Brit the chance to immigrate there in the 90s, I think they would\\'ve bitten your arm off at the opportunity, but now? I\\'d be surprised if anyone wanted to move there \"just because\".\\n\\nAnd this isn\\'t about getting hurt and saying \"Well I wouldn\\'t want to move to the UK either\", yeah, course. But in the 90s no one eye balled the UK in the way the ogggled the US with envious, excited eyes.',\n",

And hi to all you Americans sticking your head through the door. A digestive is a biscuit. It\\'s not one of those vile things you call biscuits, but an actual biscuit. It\\'s primary function is to be dipped into tea and then eaten.\\n\\nEDIT 3: Shut up, America. (Edit to the edit: To be clear, this isn\\'t for all of you. It\\'s for the group of idiots that have come in, taken this whole thing way too seriously and just been generally rude.)\\n\\nEDIT 4: For the idiot that accused me of racism, calling somebody \"crackers\" is not a racist term in the UK. If you call somebody crackers, you\\'re jokingly calling them crazy.',\n",
