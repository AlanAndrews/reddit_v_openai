As I said I've never used Reddit or apps like these but I feel the need to get this off my chest.\\n\\nLong story short I was left alone with a guy I met for the first time that night on a beach. It was very late(around maybe 3 am) and I was a little drunk since it was after a party. My male friend I've known for a long time and another guy I just met there went for a swim. And now me and this dude were completely alone. The next thing I knew he was on top of me, touching my waist and my breasts. I told him no but he didn't stop. He then tried to kiss me but I pulled away and he tried again. I asked him again if he could please stop and he didn't. He just asked if I was drunk and continued touching me and kissing me on the neck. He's a lot stronger than me as I'm a very small girl and it was hard to push him away. I then got up and told him I was going to the toilet. After I got back my friend was there and we went home.\\n\\nIs this normal or is it considered sexual assault? My friend told me what was I expecting to happen being left alone with a man and that It was expected to happen. I feel ashamed to tell anyone as I expect the same response.\\n\\nEdit: I asked because I got told it was normal. I am seeking validation for my feelings. The first thing that came to my mind after it happened was definately that this was sexual assault, but because of my surroundings I started doubting it. I also spent time with him because I trusted my male friend I was with. Them leaving caught me off guard. I'm also 18 yo and he was like 23. Deep down I know this was assault and I just need confirmation for some reason.\",\n",

Here are a few paths that some people have taken to accumulate wealth rapidly:\\n\\n1. Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Starting your own successful business and developing innovative products or services can potentially generate substantial profits. However, this path often involves high risks and a lot of hard work.\\n\\n2. High-paying Careers: Obtaining a high-paying job or career in fields such as finance, law, technology, or medicine can potentially help you earn a substantial income. It may involve obtaining advanced education, gaining experience, and networking effectively.\\n\\n3. Investments: Investing in stocks, real estate, or other promising ventures with high potential returns can allow you to accumulate wealth over time. However, this approach requires knowledge, research, and sufficient capital to invest.\\n\\n4. Entrepreneurial Investments: Investing in promising startups or businesses can lead to significant financial gains if the venture succeeds. However, it requires not only capital but the ability to identify potentially profitable opportunities.\\n\\n5. Lottery or Gambling: While high-risk and relying on luck, winning a lottery or engaging in high-stakes gambling can theoretically yield a sudden increase in wealth. Nevertheless, counting on luck is not a reliable strategy and this approach should be considered highly unlikely.\\n\\nRemember, making a million dollars quickly is not guaranteed, and financial success often takes time, effort, and careful planning. Applying a combination of the above strategies and executing them wisely can increase your chances of achieving your financial goals.\"\n",
